Admin: Administrators have administrative privileges and are responsible for managing various aspects of the university management system. They can manage the roles of everybody other than super_admin.


Dean: Deans are responsible for overseeing specific functionalities within the university. They manage the academic programs, faculty, and students within their respective side. Deans may also have the authority to make decisions regarding curriculum development and departmental policies. Also deans are able to control even the HODâ€™s of the department.


HOD (Head of Department): HODs are in charge of individual departments such as Computer Science, Information Systems, Data Analytics, Cyber Security, Project Engineering, and Regulatory Affairs. They oversee the department's operations, curriculum, faculty, and student activities.


Faculty: Faculty members are responsible for teaching courses, conducting research, and providing guidance to students within their respective departments. They may also be involved in curriculum development, assessments, and academic advising.

They may also be able to enroll in courses, track their progress, and submit assignments through the system.
